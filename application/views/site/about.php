<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:justify;">We are experienced professional traders residing in the Republic of Malta. The president of Voltus Forex, LLC, the owner/operator of voltusfx.com, began his trading career in 1998. We use a variety of strategies and methods to trade the forex market, including the use of forex robots (also commonly known as expert advisors, EAs, or automated trading software). We also trade the old-fashioned way, i.e., through "manual" or "mechanical" trading. However, we make full use of forex robots to help augment our profits.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:justify;">The retail forex trading industry is still in its infancy, and it’s the “Wild, Wild West” out there. Scammers, con artists, liars and thieves lurk around every corner in all parts of the forex industry -- trying desperately to strip you of your hard-earned money. Unfortunately, the cottage industry of selling robots is especially riddled with scams. In fact, almost all robots are absolutely worthless, and will only help you part with your money.<br><br>
We're constantly searching far and wide for successfully performing robots. Using our testing methods, we toss out the garbage and reject the scams. We hope this site helps you do the same.</p>
